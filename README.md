# MiZe
With Mize I am building the software platform, that I would want to use.

_Elevate the Unix file philosophy into the age of connectivity._

## Why am I doing this?
- What annoys me about software these days is, that things are done in so many different ways.
	- e.g: Different cloud applications for syncing data (Google Cloud, OneDrive, Dropbox)
	- e.g: Every app stores the data it deals with in it's own way (the way that the developer thought is best for this particular app)

- Back when Unix came out **everything** was stored in one place: the file system of the computer. 
	- (just as simple bytestreams/files, organized by a folder-structure)
	- and NO program stored and synced any data around in unpredictable ways.

- This philosophy is still used in every Unix/Linux machine, on a local level, but completely abstracted away (especially on mobile phones) from the user (by every app).

- I would say: The Unix file system just hasn't evolved into the age of connectivity. It is still completely the same. And I think it shouldn't be.

- MiZe aims to bring that idea of storing all data
	- in one place
	- in one predictable and simple way
	- and programs only taking data from there and not storing it everywhere in messy ways

- That's why the slogan is going to be: _Elevate the unix file philosophy into the age of connectivity._
